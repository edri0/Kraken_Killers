# SER225 Platformer Game

## What is this?
This is a platformer game created for Quinnipiac's SER225 Agile Development class. In this class this game was modified to have a Pirates of the Carribean theme and many different features to help game play stay engaging and feel immersive. 

## How to run this project?
I did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Java (min version 8).
I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.
